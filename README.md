***Project Title - Super Mall Web Application - Manage Shopâ€™s Offer***
Technologies  -  HTML, CSS, JS, and Firebase
 Project Difficulties level - Hard
 
 Problem Statement:
 A SuperMall Web app is a website that allows merchants to advertise and sell their 
products at developing counters. Rural towns would be able to sell their 
commodities to the rest of the globe as a result of this.
 The goal of this project is to establish a portal that allows consumers to securely 
update product information using a mobile device while also allowing them to 
purchase goods from the merchant. The user's primary concern is to discover their 
talents and to improve our commercial business's ability to reach out to 
customers.
 In the future, the internet will become the heart and soul of the business world; all 
trades will be conducted through it, therefore this gateway may be beneficial to 
the user as a business.
